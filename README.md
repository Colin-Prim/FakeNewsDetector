# FakeNewsDetector

This project was taken from Data Flair at the following link:
https://data-flair.training/blogs/advanced-python-project-detecting-fake-news/

The intention behind this project is to better understand machine learning algorithms and functions in Python.
It is not an original project. As such, I will be commenting frequently regarding the operations that certain functions
use for the purposes of my own understanding.
